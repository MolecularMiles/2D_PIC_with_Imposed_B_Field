# 2D_PIC_with_Imposed_B_Field
Similar to the old electrostatic PIC, I just added the ability to impose an external magnetic field. 

Jan 27: This thing is busted. Produces nonsense results. Trying to figure our what is going wrong. 
Later Jan 27: Figured out that I wasn't actually using any leapfrog code, just some weird code.I don't actually know what I was doing?
